			<h2>The Founders</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Donald Sutherland</strong> and <strong>Susan Sutherland</strong> are the visionary
				duo behind Cold Stone Creamery. Their partnership began in 1988 in Tempe, Arizona,
				where they combined their love for ice cream with a revolutionary "mix-in" concept
				that would change dessert forever.
			</p>

			<h2>The Journey</h2>
			<h3>From a Small Shop to Global Phenomenon</h3>
			<p>
				Before establishing Cold Stone, the Sutherlands experimented with various ice cream
				concepts. Their breakthrough came with the idea of mixing custom toppings into premium
				ice cream on a frozen granite stone—creating a theatrical, personalized dessert experience.
			</p>

			<h3>The Cold Stone Experience</h3>
			<p>
				The first Cold Stone Creamery opened its doors in 1988, featuring super-premium ice cream
				made fresh daily and an entertaining "stone mixing" performance. Customers could choose
				from dozens of mix-ins—everything from fresh fruits to candy bars to brownie chunks—
				all folded into their ice cream right before their eyes.
			</p>

			<h3>Birth of a Dessert Empire</h3>
			<p>
				By the early 2000s, Cold Stone had expanded across the United States and internationally.
				Their goal was simple: deliver the ultimate ice cream experience by combining
				exceptional quality, endless customization, and show-stopping entertainment.

			<p>
				"We believe ice cream should be an experience, not just a treat," says Donald Sutherland.
				"Every scoop is made to order with the freshest ingredients, mixed with love on our
				iconic cold stone."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cold Stone aesthetic is characterized by:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Super-Premium Ice Cream:</strong> 12-14% butterfat for ultimate creaminess</li>
				<li><strong>Endless Customization:</strong> Over 30 mix-ins and 20+ ice cream flavors</li>
				<li><strong>Signature Creations:</strong> Expertly crafted combinations like Founder’s Favorite®</li>
				<li><strong>Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Real fruits, nuts, and baked goods mixed in daily</li>
				<li><strong>Entertainment Factor:</strong> Crew members sing for tips and perform mixing shows</li>
			</ul>
